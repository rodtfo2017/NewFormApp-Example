# NewFormApp-Example

This app is a simple form app that demonstrates the EditText, TextViews, and the onClick attribute on a ButtonView 
in a XML layout. The user types in information and clicks the button, launches an Intent to another Activity that displays
what was typed in. The app is a modification of the Android "Build Your First App" on developer.android.com.
